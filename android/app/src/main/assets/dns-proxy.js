/**
 * A loopback proxy that exists to give musl clients working DNS.
 *
 * The Claude Code CLI is a musl binary, and musl resolves names by reading
 * /etc/resolv.conf. Android has no such file and no writable /etc -- name
 * resolution there lives in Bionic, behind netd. So the CLI resolves nothing:
 * measured on an API 36 emulator, getaddrinfo("api.anthropic.com") fails with
 * EAI_AGAIN from a musl binary while the identical call from a Bionic one
 * returns an address, and a raw TCP connect to a literal address succeeds from
 * both. DNS is the only broken part.
 *
 * This process is Node, so it is Bionic, so its DNS works. Pointing the CLI at
 * 127.0.0.1 through HTTPS_PROXY means it only ever dials a literal address and
 * never resolves anything; the name is resolved here instead. With the proxy in
 * place the same CLI reaches api.anthropic.com and gets a real HTTP 401 back
 * from an invalid key, where without it every attempt failed with no status at
 * all and retried until it gave up.
 *
 * Both proxy shapes are implemented because HTTPS_PROXY is exported to the whole
 * server process, and VS Code's own proxy resolver reads it too: CONNECT for
 * TLS, and forwarding for a request that arrives as an absolute URI. Node's own
 * http/https modules ignore these variables, but that is a statement about
 * Node's modules and not about extension code, which is the mistake this
 * paragraph used to make: a library that reads the environment itself, needle
 * for one, forwards an absolute https URI over the plain leg rather than
 * opening a tunnel. So the forwarding leg carries TLS traffic in practice and
 * has to honour the scheme it was given. See the branch that picks between
 * http.request and https.request below for what it cost when it did not.
 *
 * The listener lives inside the editor server, not inside the bootstrap that
 * forks it, and that is a correctness requirement rather than a preference. The
 * bootstrap is SIGKILLed as a matter of routine here -- the OOM killer and
 * Android's phantom-process limit both do it, which is what ProcessManager's
 * watchdog exists for -- while the server it forked keeps running and keeps the
 * port, and the next launch adopts that survivor rather than losing the user's
 * session. A proxy bound in the bootstrap died with it and left the survivor
 * pointing HTTPS_PROXY at a port nothing was listening on for the whole of that
 * session: the Open VSX gallery, extension installs, the agent host, the CLI,
 * and git, npm and curl in every terminal, since terminals inherit the same
 * environment, all failed to reach the network while the workbench itself
 * looked healthy because it is reached by address through NO_PROXY. A running
 * process's environment cannot be changed from outside, so the address had to
 * become one the process can keep answering. `server.js` therefore preloads this
 * file into the child it forks (`--require`) and the child binds its own proxy
 * and sets its own environment, which costs no extra process against the
 * 32-process budget and gives the listener exactly the lifetime of the server
 * that uses it.
 *
 * Binding to 127.0.0.1 is not access control on Android. Loopback is not
 * per-app isolated -- any installed app can connect to another app's loopback
 * port -- so an unauthenticated forwarder here is reachable by every app on the
 * device, and would let any of them make arbitrary outbound connections that
 * appear to come from VSCodroid. The random port only raises the cost of
 * finding it. Hence Basic proxy auth with a token minted per boot: the
 * credentials ride in the proxy URL, which is how every standard proxy client
 * already learns them, so nothing downstream needs to know this exists.

        // It changes the shape of the failure rather than removing it, and the
        // cheaper shape is the point. Node closes connections past the cap at
        // accept time and cannot tell this app's clients from anyone else's, so
        // a local app that opens 128 sockets denies the proxy to git, npm and
        // the CLI. Without the cap the same app needed roughly 32k of them and
        // took the descriptors of the process serving the workbench with it.
        //
        // A cap alone would make that lockout permanent, which is what the
        // header-phase bound passed to createServer above is for: sockets that
        // hold a slot without ever completing a request are swept, so the peer
        // has to keep re-dialling to keep the proxy denied rather than
        // connecting once and walking away. Both values have to be given at
        // construction to get that: a bound enforced by a sweep is only as sharp
        // as the sweep, and assigning server.headersTimeout afterwards leaves
        // connectionsCheckingInterval at its 30 s default. Measured on node
        // v22.23.2, a peer held at headersTimeout = 1000 assigned that way died
        // at 30.0 s -- a number that reads as one second and never is.
        //
        // What the pair does, measured on node v20.19.5, v22.23.2 and v24.18.0
        // (the bundled runtime), with the two options at 1000 ms and 500 ms so
        // the timings are readable: a peer that sends nothing, and one that
        // sends a request line and stops, are both answered 408 and closed
        // between one and two sweeps later (1.5 s on v20, 1.0 s on the other
        // two), while an established CONNECT tunnel and an established upgrade
        // sit silent for 3 s and still carry a byte afterwards on all three --
        // Node stops tracking a connection once its parser is detached, which is
        // what either handshake does. A keep-alive connection idle for 2.5 s
        // between two requests is untouched, and server.unref() below still lets
        // the process exit immediately, because Node unrefs the sweep timer.

// Self-start, when `server.js` preloads this file into the editor server it
// forks. See the top of this file for why the listener has to live in that
// process rather than in the bootstrap.
//
// The `--require` and the flag are both taken out of this process's own state
// before anything else runs, and both halves matter. `fork` passes the parent's
// execArgv on by default and the editor server hands it to `new Worker` as well,
// so left in place the option that brought this file here would ride into every
// helper the editor server starts: the file watcher, the agent host, the
// extension host and the pty host would each load this module, and each bind a
// proxy of its own and point its own environment at it -- several listeners where
// one was asked for, on a port every app on the device can reach. Removing the
// option means they are never asked to load it; clearing the flag means that
// loading it would still do nothing.
//
// Nothing here may throw. A `--require` module that throws stops the process
// loading its main script at all, and that process is the editor server, so a
// failure to bind must cost musl clients their DNS and nothing else -- the
// contract [start] already documents, made mechanical.
//
// The variables land one turn late, and it is what the server does with them
// that makes that safe. [start] resolves in its listen callback, so process.env
// carries no proxy variables for the whole synchronous load of
// vscode-reh/out/server-main.js that follows this preload. The shipped bundle
// reads them per request: its proxy lookup takes an environment as a parameter
// and the request service builds that from process.env on every call, so a
// request made after the listener is up finds them. A bundle that instead
// snapshotted process.env at import would silently have no proxy, which is why
// this is written down rather than left to be rediscovered.
