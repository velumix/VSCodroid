        // 2026-08-12 the file this app wrote was not read at all: the workbench
        // takes remote settings from <server-data-dir>/data/Machine/settings.json
        // (server.main.ts:39-40, environmentService.ts:86,
        // remoteAgentEnvironmentImpl.ts:112), and we were writing a sibling
        // User/settings.json. Fixing the path made every other default take
        // effect; it does not make this one work.
        // isWorkspaceTrustEnabled() checks environmentService.disableWorkspaceTrust
        // before it consults the configuration at all, so the flag is the only
        // route that works, and webClientServer passes it through to the web
        // client as enableWorkspaceTrust.
        //
        // Deliberate trade-off, not an oversight: the default workspace is the
        // user's own projects directory inside the app sandbox, where a trust
        // prompt asks about files they created themselves on their own device.
        // The exposure this accepts is a folder opened through the SAF picker
        // from somewhere else, whose eslint.config.js the bundled ESLint
        // extension then loads and executes without asking.
        //
        // It cannot be decided per folder from here, and that is a fact about
        // where the flag is read rather than a shortcut taken in this file. The
        // server parses it once at spawn and answers every page load from that
        // single value -- `enableWorkspaceTrust: !args["disable-workspace-trust"]`
        // in vscode-reh/out/server-main.js -- while this app spawns the server
        // before any folder has been chosen and switches folders by navigating
        // the same WebView on the same port. Following the folder would mean
        // restarting the server on every switch, which throws away the session
        // that reused port exists to keep. The place with both the folder and a
        // user to ask is the SAF picker, on the Android side.
        //
        // And the flag buys more than convenience: dbaeumer.vscode-eslint and
        // ms-python.python both declare `untrustedWorkspaces.supported: false`
        // in their manifests, so without it neither activates at all, for the
        // user's own projects directory just as much as for a device folder.
