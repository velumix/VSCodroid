     * The VIEW filter on this activity is exported and BROWSABLE, so any
     * installed app and any page the user taps a link on can start the editor
     * directly, and a `singleTask` activity started that way builds a fresh
     * instance rather than going through [SplashActivity]. On an install whose
     * setup has never run there is nothing behind it: measured after clearing
     * app data, `files/` held only `home` and `profileInstalled`, and the
     * service spawned `libnode.so` five times, each dying on a missing
     * `libz.so.1`, before telling the user the server had crashed repeatedly.
     * The same entry also skips the repairs [SplashActivity] runs on every
     * launch, so a session reached this way runs on dangling `usr/bin` symlinks
     * and on `settings.json` paths naming the previous install's native library
     * directory.
     *
     * The filter stays on this activity rather than moving to the splash
     * screen, and that is a decision rather than an omission. A callback
     * arriving while the editor is running has to reach `onNewIntent` on the
     * live page; routing every one of them through [SplashActivity] would run
     * its launch repairs with a device folder open, and
     * [SafStorageManager.reclaimRevokedMirrors] is placed there precisely
     * because nothing else guarantees no folder is open.
     *
     * The intent travels with the hand-off, so the sign-in this filter exists
     * for is not lost: [SplashActivity] passes `data` and the extras on to the
     * activity it launches once setup finishes.
     *
     * It cannot loop. Every route from [SplashActivity] to this activity runs
     * after `markSetupComplete()`, which is what `isFirstRun()` reads, and the
     * one screen that does not reach it (a failed setup) offers Retry and no
     * way past. A future route that launched the editor with setup still
     * incomplete would bounce back here, so keep that property when adding one.

     * one VIEW filter the manifest still declares. Anything else is the launcher
     * bringing this singleTask activity to the front, and there is nothing to do
     * for it.
     *
     * Both entry points feed this, and only one of them used to exist. The
     * callback opens in the browser while the workbench runs in this WebView, and
     * Android is free to kill an app whose screen the browser has taken; a phone
     * under memory pressure signing into an extension is a routine way to get
     * there. The returning `vscodroid://callback` then builds a *new*
     * `MainActivity`, whose `onCreate` never looked at `intent.data`;
     * `SplashActivity.launchMain()` even forwards the data along, and it was
     * dropped on arrival.
     *
     * Reading it is where the recovery stops, though, and the reason is in the
     * workbench rather than here. `out/vs/code/browser/workbench/workbench.js`
     * keeps the ids it is waiting for in a plain in-memory Set
     * (`pendingCallbacks = new Set`, added to when a request is created, and never
     * written to storage), and `checkCallbacks()` iterates *that*, reading
     * `localStorage` only for ids already in it. So a relayed value is consumable
     * by exactly the page instance that began the sign-in. Once that page is
     * gone, which is the whole premise of arriving through `onCreate`, injecting
     * would write a key nothing ever reads and fire an event nothing is
     * listening for, and leave the value behind permanently, since the cleanup
     * is also keyed on the pending set.
     *
     * So this says so instead. A user who came back from the browser expecting
     * to be signed in is owed the reason, and "sign in again" is an instruction
     * they can act on; silently relaying into a page that drops it is the
     * failure that was already there, wearing a fix.
     *
     * The two refusals below are deliberately not alike. A request this app never
     * launched is refused in the log and nowhere else: the filter is exported, so
     * a message there would be one an outside caller could raise at any moment. A
     * request it did launch, arriving past its window, is worth a message for the
     * same reason the restart case is.
     *
     * That second message is bounded rather than gated, and the difference
     * matters. It is not out of reach of an outside caller: the id is a small
     * integer the workbench counts from one, and a record is kept past its own
     * window on purpose, so anything on the device can name a request the user
     * really did start. What it cannot do is repeat, because the record is taken
     * back as the message goes up -- one explanation per launch, and every
     * further arrival for that id lands in the silent branch above.
     *
     * Both messages are fixed text; nothing from the callback reaches the screen.

     * work that exists in no other place: anything under `node_modules`, `.git`,
     * `__pycache__` or `.gradle`, which the sync excludes by construction, and

     * storage command, so a question nobody answered is reported as a refusal
     * rather than as a caller timing out.

     * for a fallback action, not to `Generic.kcm`, and some of those maps still
     * carry `ESCAPE base: fallback BACK`. AOSP ships one:
     * `Vendor_18d1_Product_5018.kcm`, headed "Key character map for Google Pixel C
     * Keyboard", which is present on a stock API 33 image where `Generic.kcm` and
     * `Virtual.kcm` both read `base: none`. The BACK it produces is
     * indistinguishable from a real one by the time it reaches
     * [setupBackNavigation]'s callback, which minimises the app.
     *
     * ⚠️ **This override is only half of it, and not the half that fixes a
     * terminal.** There are two routes to that fallback and they do not meet.
     * This one is the route where nothing in the view tree consumed the key, which
     * is what happens when the WebView does not hold focus; reporting the key
     * handled here closes it. The route that matters with the workbench focused
     * runs through `WebViewClient.onUnhandledKeyEvent` instead, and the event it
     * re-injects is queued with `FLAG_UNHANDLED`, which `deliverInputEvent` sends
     * to `mSyntheticInputStage` INSTEAD of the stage that would deliver it here.
     * So this method never sees it, and cannot. That route is closed in
     * [VSCodroidWebViewClient.onUnhandledKeyEvent], which carries the full
     * mechanism; the bootstrap client in [bootstrapClient] closes the same route
     * for the window before the real client is installed.
     *
     * Testing `FLAG_FALLBACK` on a BACK here would have covered the second route
     * on Android 13 and 14 and missed it on 15 and 16: with predictive back
     * enabled, and it is by default at this app's `targetSdk`,
     * `NativePreImeInputStage` claims every BACK before the view tree, with no
     * exemption for a synthesised one.
     *
     * `super` runs first and its answer is kept, so the WebView receives the key
     * exactly as dispatched and the workbench keeps every binding it has for
     * Escape. Only the verdict reported back to the input pipeline widens. Every
     * other key, `KEYCODE_BACK` included, passes through untouched, so the back
     * gesture, the hardware back key and predictive back are unaffected.
     *
     * ⚠️ Not reproducible with `adb shell input keyevent 111`, and neither is the
     * fix: an injected event carries `Virtual.kcm`, whose ESCAPE has no fallback,
     * and the emulator's own keyboard resolves to `qwerty2.kcm`, which declares no
     * ESCAPE at all. It takes a real HID keyboard whose map has the line.

     * `Accept-Language` entry. Left alone, that means the header decides the
     * page while [EditorLocale] decides the server process, and the two can
     * disagree: `android:localeConfig` lets someone set this app to Korean on an
     * English phone, and whether the WebView's header follows the app's locale
     * or the system's is not something this app controls. The failure is not a
     * crash, it is a workbench in one language and its extension host in
     * another, with nothing on screen to explain it.
     *
     * So the cookie is written from the same answer the server process is given,
     * and the header is never consulted. `en` is written rather than nothing
     * when no bundle fits, because a cookie already on the WebView from an
     * earlier language would otherwise stand: the server reads any locale
     * starting with "en" as "serve the English that already ships".
     *
     * Called from [loadVSCode] rather than once per WebView, so a language
     * changed while the app is running is picked up by the next navigation
     * rather than only by the next process. Measured on an emulator: switching
     * the per-app language while the editor was open brought it back in the new
     * language without a restart.
     *
     * The address carries no port, and that is not an omission. A cookie is
     * scoped to a host and a path, never to a port, so this one is sent to the
     * editor server whatever port it ends up on. Naming the port would also put

     * Keeps the soft keyboard down until the user actually aims at text.
     *
     * The editor's caret lives in a focusable element the workbench focuses
     * whenever it hands focus back to the editor: after the Explorer opens or
     * closes, after a file is opened from the tree, after a view is toggled. On
     * a desktop that is invisible. Here Chromium answers a focused editing host
     * by raising the input method, so browsing files covered half the screen
     * with a keyboard nobody asked for, which is what people report as "every
     * time I touch something the keyboard appears".
     *
     * The element is `div.native-edit-context`, not a textarea: this build of
     * the workbench uses the EditContext API. That was measured over the
     * DevTools protocol rather than assumed, after a first version of this
     * guard aimed at `textarea.inputarea`, matched nothing at all, and still
     * appeared to work because the keyboard happened not to rise in the one
     * case that was tried. Monaco also keeps a `textarea.ime-text-area` around,
     * which is not the focus target; both selectors are kept so that a version
     * bump away from EditContext does not silently disarm this.
     *
     * The mechanism is `inputmode="none"`, which tells Chromium to leave the
     * keyboard alone for an element that still takes key events, so a hardware
     * keyboard and the extra key row are unaffected. Three things have to
     * happen for it to hold:
     *
     * - it is set on whatever exists when this runs, and
     * - on any editing host that takes focus later, which is how opening a file
     *   is covered: that builds a new editor, and its element does not exist at
     *   the moment of the tap that opened it. Answering the focus is enough on
     *   its own, and it is answered by taking the focus away and giving it back
     *   with the attribute in place, because by the time the event arrives the
     *   browser has already decided to raise the keyboard. A MutationObserver
     *   over the document did the same job a moment earlier and was dropped: it
     *   ran on every line the editor rendered, which on a phone is every scroll.
     * - it is removed when a touch on text turns out to be a tap rather than a
     *   scroll, which is decided at pointerup by how far the finger travelled.
     *   Deciding it at pointerdown is the obvious shape and is wrong: dragging
     *   inside the editor is how a phone scrolls a file, so it put the keyboard
     *   up over half the screen on every scroll. The element usually already has
     *   focus by then, so no focus event follows; hence the same blur and
     *   refocus, inside the gesture, which is what raises the keyboard.
     *
     * Measured on an API 37 emulator at 411dp, `dumpsys input_method` beside a
     * screenshot each time. Tapping the Explorer icon: was `mInputShown=true`,
     * now false. Opening a file from the tree: was true, now false. Dragging to
     * scroll a file: was true, now false. Tapping a word: true, with the caret
     * on it and the keyboard up.
     *
     * What it deliberately does not do is raise the keyboard where the editor
     * itself would not take focus. A tap inside the editor but off the text
     * lands on a container Monaco ignores, and the keyboard now follows the
     * focus rather than the touch: measured, focusin never fires for that tap.
     * The version before this one raised it anyway, which is a keyboard over a
     * file with no caret in it.
     *
     * The terminal is left alone. It has an editing host of its own, and
     * opening a terminal is asking to type.

     * Keeps a context menu alive on a phone, and keeps Escape able to close it.
     *
     * With the keyboard up, a long press on a word opened the editor's menu and
     * closed it again about 60ms later, which reads as a menu that flickers or
     * never appears. Measured on an API 36 emulator with the menu's shadow root
     * watched by a MutationObserver and `HTMLElement.prototype.focus` wrapped
     * to record its caller: the menu is added, its action bar calls `focus()`,
     * the editor loses focus, Android takes the keyboard down, the viewport
     * grows from 458px to 845px, and the workbench answers that resize with
     * `Workbench.layout` -> `ContextView.layout` -> `hide`. That `layout` hides
     * any non-relayoutable context view on every layout unless the platform
     * is iOS, and every context menu is non-relayoutable. `onHide` then focuses
     * the editor again, the keyboard comes back, and the viewport shrinks to
     * 458px: a full keyboard bounce for a menu the user never saw. The stack
     * trace named each frame; this is not inferred from the order of events.
     *
     * Patch 0015 met the same chain on the menubar and excused Android from
     * the menubar's own resize listener. `ContextView.layout` is a different
     * listener and is not covered by it. It could be patched the same way,
     * but a patched bundle does not reach an installed app: `/static` is served
     * for a year under a URL keyed by the upstream commit, which a rebuild of
     * the same VS Code version does not change, and nothing here clears the
     * WebView cache. So the fix has to arrive with the app, which is here.
     *
     * The chain is broken at its first link. On a coarse pointer, a `focus()`
     * call that would move focus OUT of an editing host and INTO a context
     * view is ignored: the editor keeps focus, the keyboard stays where it
     * is, no resize fires, and `ContextView.layout` never runs. Everything
     * the menu does by pointer still works without focus, and all of it was
     * measured: tapping an item runs it (Rename Symbol opened its box),
     * tapping outside closes it, a submenu opens on tap, and a real long
     * press with the keyboard up opened a 22-item menu that was still there
     * 2.3 seconds later with the editor focused and the viewport unchanged.
     *
     * What focus was doing for the menu is keyboard handling, and one key
     * matters on a phone: Escape, which the extra key row carries. A menu
     * without focus never sees it, so a capture listener forwards Escape to
     * an open menu's action bar when that bar does not hold focus, and stops
     * the editor from seeing the same press, which is what the editor got
     * before this change too (focus was in the menu). Arrow-key navigation
     * inside a menu is the trade, and it is taken deliberately: it needs a
     * hardware keyboard on a device that still reports `pointer: coarse`,
     * which is a tablet with a Bluetooth keyboard, and that user can tap.
     *
     * The gate is the editing host, not the menu. Focus moving into a menu
     * from anywhere else, the explorer say, moves no keyboard and is left
     * alone, so a mouse-and-keyboard tablet loses nothing.
     *
     * The same shadow root is why the keybinding labels in that menu could not
     * be styled from the page: the host is created with `:host { all: initial }`
     * and copies only VS Code's own menu CSS into itself, so the stylesheet
     * [injectTouchTargetCSS] installs never reaches it (measured:
     * `#vscodroid-touch-css` absent from the root, its 40px floor not applied,
     * the label `display: block`). A sheet adopted by the shadow root is the
     * one channel in, and it is added as the root is created by wrapping
     * `attachShadow` on the host the workbench names, plus once for a host
     * that already exists, since this runs again after a folder switch. The
     * rule mirrors the light-DOM one beside the context-view rules in
     * [injectTouchTargetCSS], and `TouchContextMenuWiringTest` holds the two
     * to the same text.

     * Targets WCAG 2.5.5 minimum 44×44px for primary actions, 36px for list items.
     *
     * The test is `pointer: coarse`, not a viewport width, because what these rules
     * compensate for is the fingertip, and a fingertip does not change size with the
     * screen. A phone held in landscape is wider than any width threshold that still
     * excludes tablets, so a width test left exactly the orientation people turn to
     * for code width with desktop-sized targets. Conversely a tablet driven by a
     * mouse or a DeX-style desktop reports `fine` and correctly gets none of this.
     *
     * Height would have been the wrong axis for the same reason it looks tempting:
     * `windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` on MainActivity in the manifest shrinks the
     * window when the soft keyboard opens, and the WebView takes what is left
     * (`layout_weight="1"`), so a height threshold would switch the sizing on and off
     * while the user types.
     *
     * It has to be a media query rather than anything sampled in Kotlin: this runs
     * once per page load, and MainActivity's `configChanges` in the manifest absorbs
     * `orientation`, `screenSize` and `screenLayout` among others, with no
     * `onConfigurationChanged`, so nothing re-invokes the injection when the window
     * changes. Line numbers are left off deliberately: both citations here named
     * the right attribute and the wrong line within a day of being written. Letting the browser hold the condition costs nothing and never goes
     * stale.

     * Answers the workbench's clipboard READ out of Android's clipboard.
     *
     * Copy works and paste does not, and the asymmetry is the WebView's: it
     * grants the page `clipboard-write` and refuses `clipboard-read`. There is
     * no site-permission UI in a WebView to grant it in, and
     * `WebChromeClient.onPermissionRequest` has no clipboard resource to grant
     * even if there were, so nothing the user can do makes the read succeed.
     *
     * What the workbench does with the rejection is the visible half. Its one
     * `IClipboardService.readText` catches it and raises a STICKY notification
     * telling the user to grant a permission that does not exist here, and the
     * promise only settles when they dismiss it, resolving the empty string. So
     * every paste costs a modal that cannot be acted on and pastes nothing.
     *
     * [ClipboardBridge.readFromClipboard] has been able to answer this the whole
     * time. It is token-validated, it declines to open a `content://` URI through
     * our own ContentResolver, and it is unit-tested. It simply had no caller in
     * the page: the only hits outside the built tree were the bridge itself and
     * its test. This is that caller.
     *
     * On the prototype rather than on `navigator.clipboard`, because the call
     * site resolves the method off the ACTIVE window's navigator on every paste
     * rather than capturing it once, and the prototype is what every one of those
     * lookups ends at. The instance is patched instead only where the interface
     * global is missing, which is not this WebView but costs two lines to be sure
     * of.
     *
     * Injected after load, which is soon enough and provably so: nothing captures
     * `readText` at bundle-evaluation time. The one thing read that early is a
     * capability probe that tests the method for truthiness to decide whether to
     * register the terminal's paste command, and a wrapper is still a function,
     * so the probe answers the same either way.
     *
     * The original is tried FIRST and this only answers its rejection. A WebView
     * that one day grants the permission then keeps its own answer, and the
     * fallback costs a rejected promise per paste until it does.
     *
     * A null answer is the empty string, not an error: the bridge returns null
     * for a clipboard holding no text, and pasting nothing is the correct outcome
     * there. A missing bridge or a missing token rethrows instead, so a genuine
     * failure still reaches the user as the error it is rather than as a paste
     * that silently did nothing.
     *
     * Fixes the editor, the terminal, the command palette and every extension's
     * `vscode.env.clipboard.readText()` at once: all of them are that one service.

     * every download of a file the editor could hold in memory.

     * blocks the page until it returns, so reporting the name here puts it on
     * the Android side before the download hook can ask for it.

    /**
     * Injects a BroadcastChannel relay into the WebView main page.
     *
     * Browser extensions run in a Web Worker, which has its own global scope and does
     * not see objects added to a page with addJavascriptInterface. This relay listens on
     * a BroadcastChannel in the page and forwards calls to AndroidBridge, which is what
     * lets an extension reach it at all.
     *
     * ⚠️ **Who can post here is every script on the workbench's origin, not the
     * bundled extension.** `product.json` carries no `webEndpointUrlTemplate`, and
     * without one the workbench starts the web extension host in a SAME-ORIGIN
     * iframe and says so (`console.warn("The web worker extension host is started
     * in a same-origin iframe!")` in `out/vs/code/browser/workbench/workbench.js`). A
     * `BroadcastChannel` is scoped by origin, so every web extension the user
     * installs from Open VSX shares this one. The token read below is no barrier
     * either: it is read out of `window.__vscodroid` by this script, on that same
     * origin, so anything that can post can also read it. Answers are posted back
     * onto the same channel, so every listener sees every reply, including replies
     * to commands somebody else asked for.
     *
     * What that means for what may be dispatched here, worked out per command
     * rather than assumed:
     *
     *  - The caller ALREADY has more than this channel gives it. A web extension
     *    can open a terminal and run anything as this app's uid, so every reading
     *    command here (`getRecentFolders`, `getStorageBreakdown`, `listSafMirrors`,
     *    `getSshPublicKey`, `listSshKeys`, `generateBugReport`) discloses what the
     *    caller could already read off the filesystem. They stay, and what changes
     *    instead is that they hand over no more than they must: `listSshKeys` no
     *    longer reports a key's comment, which is conventionally an email address.
     *  - Commands that put an Android surface on screen (`openFolderPicker`,
     *    `openToolchainSettings`, `showAboutDialog`) are visible and dismissible,
     *    and none of them changes anything on its own. They stay.
     *  - `generateSshKey` never overwrites a pair, and `clearCaches` deletes only
     *    regenerable caches. Neither loses the user's own work.
     *  - `openExternalUrl` is the one command that reaches outside the app at all,
     *    and it is the one that was narrowed: see `AndroidBridge.openExternalUrl`,
     *    which now refuses this app's own `vscodroid://callback`.
     *  - `openRecentFolder` carries the URI with the call, so the folder it opens
     *    is the caller's choice rather than the user's. What bounds it is the
     *    grant: the recent list a legitimate caller picks from is pruned of
     *    revoked grants before it is handed over
     *    (`SafStorageManager.getPersistedFolders`), and a URI this app holds no
     *    grant for is now refused with a notice instead of being answered with the
     *    system folder chooser. See [openRecentSafFolder].
     *  - `reclaimSafMirror` with `force` is the only command here that destroys
     *    user data, and its own documentation says the caller must have confirmed
     *    a modal saying so. A caller is exactly what cannot be asked to promise
     *    that, so [removeDeviceFolderCopy] now asks the user itself.

     * Relays an extension auth callback from Chrome into the WebView's localStorage.

     * VS Code's callback.html writes auth tokens to localStorage, but on Android
     * the callback opens in Chrome while the workbench runs in WebView: separate
     * localStorage domains. This method receives the token data via deep link
     * (vscodroid://callback?data=ENCODED_JSON) and injects it into the WebView's
     * localStorage so the workbench can pick it up.
     *
     * The payload is read once, here, and what goes into the page is the result
     * rather than the text. Both halves of that matter and neither is style.
     *
     * **Once.** `callback.html` encodes exactly one time
     * (`encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify({ id, uri }))`) and
     * `Uri.getQueryParameter` undoes it, which is why [callbackRequestId] can
     * parse what arrives as JSON at all. The script this used to inject then ran
     * `decodeURIComponent` over that already-decoded text, so every percent
     * escape in the callback was undone a second time, and `uri.query` is
     * percent-encoded by construction: `callback.html` builds it with
     * `params.toString()`. Measured end to end, a query of
     * `code=4%2F0AX4XfWjA%2BbQ%2FcD&state=a%26b%3Dc` reached the workbench as
     * `code=4/0AX4XfWjA+bQ/cD&state=a&b=c`, so the `+` inside a base64 code
     * became a space, `state` was truncated at the injected `&`, and a
     * parameter the provider never sent appeared beside them. A callback
     * carrying a double quote went further and made `JSON.parse` throw, ending
     * the sign-in with nothing on screen. GitHub's flow is hex and a uuid with
     * nothing to escape, which is how this survived.
     *
     * **The result, not the text.** The gate in [receiveCallbackIntent] and the
     * page were parsing the same attacker-supplied bytes by two different
     * grammars, so the id the gate approved was not necessarily the id the page
     * wrote under. The id now comes from the caller, which is the value the gate
     * matched against [AuthTabWindow], and the address is taken from the same
     * parse; the page is handed two finished literals and does no parsing at
     * all.

 * exactly with the moment a callback is being delivered. The workbench holds the
 * requests it is waiting on in memory, so the reload discards them and the
 * sign-in that had just succeeded is lost with no error anywhere.
 *
 * Downgraded to the probe rather than dropped, and that is the whole of what a
 * pending sign-in buys. The absence really was long enough for the connection to
 * have died, so answering it with nothing leaves the page in the state the
 * five-minute rule exists to repair -- and nothing would come back to it, because
 * this decision is only ever made on the way in from the background and each
 * arrival is judged on its own absence. The probe is the strongest answer that is
 * safe here: it only reloads when IndexedDB is already unusable, and a page in
 * that state has nothing left to collect a callback with.
 *
 * [fileChooserPending] outranks both, and gets the stronger answer rather than
 * the probe. The difference from a sign-in is that the answer is already
 * arriving: the picker is another app, so the browse *is* the absence, and the
 * chosen file is handed to this same document moments after this decision. The
 * probe would not be enough, on two counts. It reloads the page from JS when
 * IndexedDB is unusable, which discards the selection just as the forced reload
 * does; and it starts at one minute, where browsing storage for longer than that
 * is the ordinary case rather than the exotic one.
 *
 * The cost is a page left possibly stale, and it is bounded: the answer is being
 * delivered now, and the next trip through the background judges the page afresh
 * on its own absence.
 *
 * [savePickerPending] is the same absence reached by the other picker and gets
 * the same answer. Saving a download opens the create-document picker, which is
 * another app, and the answer comes back into this same document: the
 * coordinator asks the page for the bytes only after the destination is chosen,
 * so a reload here leaves the user having named a file that can no longer be
 * read. The default is false so that this stays one argument per signal at the
 * call site rather than a boolean nobody can see; the call site is checked by a
 * test for naming it, because a dropped argument is exactly what the default
 * would otherwise hide.
 *
 * An earlier shape of this held the reload for later by putting the caller's
 * backgrounded reading back. That reading is written afresh by `onStop`, which
 * Android always delivers before the next `onStart`, so the restored value was
 * overwritten before its only consumer could read it and the reload was dropped

 * `loadData` does not load a document, it builds a URL out of one, and for an app
 * targeting Q or later the platform stops escaping the content: the first `#`
 * ends the URL and every byte after it becomes the fragment. The loading page
 * opens with `background:#1e1e1e`, so what the WebView actually parsed was an
 * unterminated `<body` start tag, which is dropped at end of input. The document
 * was empty and the view painted its own default white for the whole of the
 * server start, which is the first screen of every cold start and the screen the
 * Retry link puts back.
 *
 * `%` is escaped before `#`, or the `%23` written here would be escaped a second
 * time into `%2523` and reach the page as literal text.
 *
 * Not needed by [MainActivity.showServerGaveUp]: `loadDataWithBaseURL` with a
 * base URL that is not a data URL loads the content as a plain string, which is
 * why that page renders today while this one does not.

 * [VSCodroidWebChromeClient.onJsBeforeUnload] answers a `beforeunload` for the

 * reaches that callback only when the workbench vetoed leaving, and it vetoes
 * only while it holds work it has not yet written a backup of, so a wrong "yes"
 * here throws that work away with nothing on screen.
 *
 * One answer per mark, because the callback is raised once for the load
 * [mark] precedes: a mark left standing for the rest of a window answered for
 * whatever the page decided to do next, which is the case the veto exists for.
 * The window survives only as the backstop for a mark whose load never produced
 * a callback at all.
 *
 * Its own class because [MainActivity] cannot be constructed in a unit test,
 * and a rule whose failure costs unsaved work should not be the one part with
