/**
 * The one modifier query allowed to be in the air, and whose answer it is.

 * outstanding, so a renderer slow to reply is not sent a fresh one five times a
 * second for as long as a modifier stays latched.
 *
 * What it records is the injector that was asked, not merely that something was.
 * The injector owns the answer's lifetime and therefore this record's: an answer
 * travels back through `WebView.evaluateJavascript`, so a WebView destroyed
 * before it replies never delivers one. A plain "a query is out" flag would then
 * stay set for the rest of the Activity, because the row outlives the page.
 * `MainActivity.recreateWebView` replaces only the WebView: it drops the
 * injector, then reaches `initBridge` through `loadVSCode` on the same main
 * thread turn and hands this same row a new `KeyInjector`, so the poll's
 * no-injector branch is not even reached on that path. Every later tick would
 * have returned at the guard without asking, and the row would never again learn
 * that the page had spent a latched modifier: the next row key goes out as a
 * chord, and a whole trackpad drag does, since the arrow path deliberately keeps
 * the modifier.
 *
 * Asked against the injector, that cannot happen: a claim by an injector other
 * than the one owing an answer displaces it, because an answer nobody can
 * deliver is an answer nobody is waiting for. The record is therefore released
 * on four occasions and can be stuck on none of them: [claim] by a new injector,
 * [release] by the answer arriving, [abandon] when the row is left with no
 * injector at all, and [claim] again by the SAME injector once it has stayed
 * silent for [UNANSWERED_TICKS] of them. Bounded at one reference, and that
 * reference is replaced or dropped rather than accumulated.
 *
 * That fourth one is the case the other three cannot reach: a reply lost while
 * the injector it was asked of is still the row's. Nothing then displaces the
 * claim and nothing abandons it, so every later tick returned at the guard and
 * the poll went silent for the life of the page while going on ticking. It is
 * the same end state the plain flag had, arrived at by a narrower door, and the
 * cost is the same: a modifier the page has spent stays lit on the row and the
 * next key goes out as a chord. Giving the slot up after a bounded silence
 * closes it without giving back the bound, which is the whole reason the slot
 * exists: a renderer that never answers is asked once a second instead of five
 * times.
